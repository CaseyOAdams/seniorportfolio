## Overcomming College Challenges 

  One significant challenge I faced during my academic development was having to complete a large group project in each computer science class. Most of the projects we were implementing a complex code from scratch. The most challenging was my C++ coding class. The goal was to understand how to code in C++ so well that we could write a program in C++ to play chess with another person. This was challenging in both technical and nontechnical in nature. The technical aspect involved understanding the detailed aspects of the code and ensuring our implementation of the code was efficient and accurate. On the nontechnical side, the project was a group assignment, and coordinating effectively with partners, who had different working styles, was difficult.

  I overcame the technical issues in my C++ class by breaking down the algorithm into smaller, more manageable components and solved each part systematically. There had to be a lot of testing through each small step in order for the chess game to work correctly. I also sought feedback from peers and senior mentors to help me ensure that I have a great understanding and my implementation was correct.

  My solution for my nontechnical issues I took the lead and scheduled meetings with teammates to talk and discuss plans, progress, and timing of the assignment. This was also an important time to share ideas and help one another if someone was struggling on a piece of code. I also implemented collaborative tools like shared documents to streamline our workflow and ensure everyone was on the same page. 

## Teamwork

  During my time at Charleston Southern University, I completed a C++ coding class. Our final project was my teammate and myself were tasked with creating a code where two people can play chess with one another. This was a great way to test our coding skill but to also develop our collaborative skills by each working on different steps in the code and coming together to create the final code.

  Being a helpful team player was vital to my partner’s success and also my own success. I have always considered myself a team player, but this strengthened my skill in a new type of collaborative environment. I did not know all the answers for this code and neither did my teammate but together we could help one another, and we were able to complete this very difficult assignment.

  As for improvement in team skills, I believe I take on too much responsibility to ensure project success. That may come off as offensive to some people so learning to split the work more evenly or delegate more workloads would be helpful to the team. Next, because coding is very complex, sometimes I have listened to my teams’ suggestions but did not fully understand his or her point of view before acting on writing the code. This may have come off as me not truly listening to their point of view. Although this would be unintentional, it can still have a negative effect and is something I need to look out for. 

## Computer Science Goals

   I'm suited to be a good network engineer or systems administrator because I focus and improve on my technical skills, problem-solving abilities, relevant experience, and personal qualities that align with the role. I have a strong understanding of networking principles, including

  TCP/IP, subnetting, routing protocols (such as OSPF, BGP), and network security practices. I have hands-on experience configuring and managing network devices like routers, switches, and firewalls. During my job at two in point-of-sale businesses, Shift4 Payments, and currently I'm working at a local managed service provider company as a systems administrator where I'm responsible for configuring VLANs, troubleshooting network issues, ensuring network security, and optimizing network performance.

  I enjoy the systems administrator field of work as compared to only being a programmer because I feel in the systems administrator field I get to move around more, work at different locations sometimes, and interact with a wider variety of people. Collaboration with more people is important for me to be happy in my work. I like the hybrid job where sometimes I get to go onsite to work and sometimes, I can work from home and my current systems administrator job does provide that for me. 

## Using Skills Outside of College

   I personally would like to be a part of Cisco Networking academy and Cisco Certified Network Professional Community. Being part of Cisco professional networks can be greatly beneficial because of Cisco's prominence in the networking industry. These different groups within the community offer access to endless amounts of training materials, forums for discussion with potential future coworkers, and opportunities to stay updated on emerging technologies and industry trends.

  Next, my choice would be CompTIA because they provide professional development opportunities, networking opportunities, and resources for IT starters such as myself. Joining CompTIA would allow me to link with other IT professionals, attend industry events, and stay up to date with IT professionals and networking industries.

  Achieving this would give me increased job experience in cybersecurity, potential to earn certifications, deepen my knowledge, and allow me to have on the job experience. It would also allow me to expand my career prospects.

  By joining these professional organizations and committing to continuous professional development, I aim to enhance my technical skills, stay current with industry advancements, and contribute meaningfully to the field of the Information Technology Industry. 

## Putting my Degree to Use After College

  Using my Computer Science degree, I can serve the community in various impactful ways. First by creating apps to connect volunteers with those in need, or systems for real-time community updates and emergency alerts. Next, supporting nonprofits by providing IT support and developing custom software solutions for local nonprofits to enhance their operations and outreach. Finally, by using data analysis to help local governments and organizations make data-driven decisions to improve public services and community well-being. These efforts can significantly enhance community engagement, accessibility, and overall quality of life.
